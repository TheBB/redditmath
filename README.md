==========

Greasemonkey user script for rendering math on /r/math using MathJax.

How to install
--------------

Open the `RedditMath.user.js` file and click on the **Raw** button (or just go
[here](https://github.com/TheBB/redditmath/raw/master/RedditMath.user.js).)
Greasemonkey will ask you to install it.

Once installed, it should “just work.”

Problems?
---------

The only good thing that can be said about my JavaScript ability is that it's
more extensive than my GreaseMonkey ability. Please don't take anything for
granted. RedditMath was conceived strictly for my own benefit and has undergone
little testing.

With that in mind, feel free to submit issues
[here in this repo](https://github.com/TheBB/redditmath/issues)
and I'll have a look as time allows.

**Pull requests are also welcome.**
